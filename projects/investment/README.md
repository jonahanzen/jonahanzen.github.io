## Introduction

The Investment Calculator App is a Vue.js-based project that helps users calculate investment growth over time and visualize it using a bar chart. The app supports various investment methods, including a fixed number of months, a fixed number of years, and dividend-based growth.

## Features

- **Investment Calculation:** The app allows users to input the initial investment amount, the monthly contribution, the annual profit percentage, and the investment period in either months or years.

- **Chart Visualization:** Upon calculation, the app generates a dynamic bar chart that displays the investment's growth over time. It includes bars for the investment's total value, total invested amount, and total compound amount.

- **Dividend Objective:** Users can set a dividend objective, and the app calculates the time required to reach that objective based on the selected growth method.

### Language Support

The app supports multiple languages using translation files. Translations are loaded dynamically based on the selected language.
