# Portfolio Calculator

The **Portfolio Calculator** is a Python script that allows you to analyze and visualize your investment portfolio based on the content of a JSON file. You can use this script to calculate and display the average values for each column in your portfolio data and generate a bar chart for visualization purposes.

## Getting Started

1.  **Obtain Portfolio Data:** You can obtain your portfolio data in JSON format from a site called Investidor10. Log in to Investidor10, navigate to the portfolio section, and download the JSON file containing your investment data.
    
2.  **Prepare JSON File:** Once you have the JSON file, ensure that you have it saved with a suitable name, such as `acoes.json`.
    
3.  **Install Dependencies:** Before running the script, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:
    
```bash
   pip install matplotlib 
   ```
    
4.  **Run the Script:** Open the provided Python script in your preferred Python environment. Locate line 5 of the script and replace `'acoes.json'` with the path to your JSON file, e.g., `'path/to/your/portfolio.json'`.
    
5.  **Execute the Script:** Run the script. It will read the JSON file, calculate the average values for each column, and display a bar chart with the average values.
    

## How to Use

1.  **Replace JSON Path:** Open the script and update line 5 with the correct path to your JSON file containing portfolio data. This file should be in the format provided by Investidor10.
    
2.  **Run the Script:** Execute the script using your Python interpreter. The script will read the JSON file and calculate the average values for each column.
    
3.  **View Results:** The script will print the calculated average values for each column in the terminal. Additionally, it will generate a bar chart visualizing these average values.
    

## Example Usage

Suppose you have a JSON file named `acoes.json` containing your investment portfolio data. You would replace `'acoes.json'` with the actual path to your JSON file in line 5 of the script. After making this change, execute the script, and it will process your portfolio data, calculate the average values, and display a bar chart.

- Go to investidor10 site.
- Go to your portfolio
- In the request, you will notice files: fii.json, rf.json and acoes.json, they are the response from their api of your portfolio. paste those in this project.
- Change which portfolio you want to calculate in line 5 of calculate.py

## Notes

-   The script will skip columns that contain non-numeric values or cannot be converted to floats.
-   If a column contains null values, they will be excluded from the calculations.
-   The bar chart generated by the script will provide insights into the average values of different columns in your investment portfolio.
